**JetBrains Academy Python course template** is a repository that provides a
pure template to make it easier to create a new Python course with the [JetBrains Academy
plugin][ref:plugin.marketplace] (check out the [Creating a repository from a template][gh:template] article).

The main goal of this template is to speed up the setup phase
of Python course development for both new and experienced educators
by preconfiguring the project scaffold and CI,
linking to the proper documentation pages, and keeping everything organized.

If you're still not quite sure what this is all about, read our introduction: [What is the JetBrains Academy plugin?][docs:intro]

### Table of contents

In this README, we will highlight the following elements of template-project creation:

- [Getting started](#getting-started)
- [Course info configuration file](#course-info-configuration-file)
- [Course ignore file](#course-ignore-file)
- [Course dependencies](#course-dependencies)
- [Sample code](#sample-code)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Useful links](#useful-links)

## Getting started

Before we dive into course development and everything related to it, it's worth mentioning the benefits of using GitHub Templates.
By creating a new project with the current template, you start with no history or reference to this repository.
This allows you to create a new repository easily, without copying and pasting previous content, cloning repositories, or clearing the history manually.

All you need to do is click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button (you must be logged in with your GitHub account).

![Use this template][file:use-template-blur]

The most convenient way of getting your new project from GitHub is the <kbd>Get from VCS</kbd> action available on the Welcome Screen,
where you can filter your GitHub repository by its name.

    └── section-info.yaml          Section information
```

## Course info configuration file

The course info configuration file is the [course-info.yaml][file:course-info.yaml] file located in the root directory.
It provides general information about the course, like description, language, etc.

```yaml
type: marketplace
title: JetBrains Academy Python course template
language: English
summary: Here you can put the course description. You can use HTML tags inside the
  description.
programming_language: Python
environment: unittest
content:
  - course_section
```

## Course ignore file

The course ignore file is the [.courseignore][file:courseignore] file located in the root directory.
It provides the list of files or directories that will be ignored in the final course preview or archive.

```text
README.md
```

You can find more information about the course preview in the [Course preview][ref:course.preview] section. Information
about creating a course archive and uploading it to the marketplace is in the [Course distribution][ref:course.distribution] section.

## Course dependencies
You should write all your course dependencies in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. 
It will be used for creating a virtual environment before students begin the course.

Before developing the course, you should set up the environment yourself:
* For Windows:
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
* For Linux/MacOS:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Sample code

The prepared template provides an example of a course with one section, two lessons, and six tasks in total.

![Course structure in the course creator mode][file:course-structure-author]

Each course may have an unlimited number of sections, lessons, and tasks.
Students will see almost the same course structure as the educator (course author):

![Course structure in the course student mode][file:course-structure-student]

You can read more about framework lessons in the official documentation in the [Framework Lessons Creation][ref:framework.lessons.creation] section.

> **Note**
>
> Click <kbd>Course Creator</kbd> -> <kbd>Create Course Preview</kbd> in the context menu in the root of the repository to create a course preview.


The JetBrains Academy plugin provides five different types of tasks,
and you can combine them inside one lesson (whether regular or framework).
You can read more about tasks in the official documentation in the [Task][ref:tasks] section.

## Testing

To check the programming exercises for [**edu**][ref:tasks] tasks, 
you need to write tests using [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework.

You can find little examples of programming tasks in the repository in the `test.py` files:
in [course lesson][file:course.lesson.tests] and [course framework lesson][file:course.framework.lesson.tests].
