This task asks the user to implement something and runs tests from the [Tests.kt](./test/Tests.kt) file.
You need to add _placeholders_ into the places where the user needs to implement something (see [task-info.yaml](./task-info.yaml)).

This task also demonstrates how you can use the [kotlin test framework](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/kotlin-test-framework) 
to test functions or classes without using the correct implementation in the tests. 
It allows you to avoid using the correct implementation in tests directly.
